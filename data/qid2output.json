It was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, between October 25 and November 4, 2005, and followed by Civilization V.. Civilization IV uses the 4X empire-building model for turn-based strategy gameplay, in which the player's main objective is to construct a civilization from limited initial resources. Most standard full-length games start the player with a settler unit and/or a city unit in the year 4000 BC. As with other games in the series, there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game: conquering all other civilizations, controlling a supermajority of the game world's land and population, building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system, increasing the \"Culture ratings\" of at least three different cities to \"legendary\" levels, or winning a \"World Leader\" popularity contest by the United Nations."

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u201379\u00a0AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u201381).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u201396).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).. The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles."

Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS (hereditary).[6][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to disease-causing variants in one of four specific genes.[14] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing conducted to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease progression, and improve symptoms.[9] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months).[15][16] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality, and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[17] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[18] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[19] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[19] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% of those affected survive longer than ten years.[20]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[21] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[21]. ALS is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.[3] Other motor neuron diseases include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA).[22]."

The event partially took place and the film was partially shot in Sugar Land, Texas.[4] Other scenes were filmed in San Antonio, Live Oak, Floresville, Pleasanton, Converse and Del Rio, Texas.[5]. The Sugarland Express marks the first collaboration between Spielberg and composer John Williams, who has scored all but five of Spielberg's films since; this is the only score he has composed for Spielberg that has never been released as an album, although Williams re-recorded the main theme with Toots Thielemans and the Boston Pops Orchestra for 1991's The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration.[6]. Lou Jean Poplin visits her incarcerated husband, Clovis Michael Poplin, to tell him that their son will soon be placed in the care of foster parents. Even though he is four months away from being released from prison, she convinces him to escape to assist her in retrieving their child."

At the 2020 census, the population was 68,572.[5] Palo Alto is one of the most expensive cities in the United States in which to live,[6][7] and its residents are among the most educated in the country. However, it also has a youth suicide rate four times higher than the national average, often attributed to academic pressure.[8]."

Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican traditions as well as in other faiths such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism.[1] In other religions, monasticism is criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in modern Judaism.. Many monastics live in abbeys, convents, monasteries, or priories to separate themselves from the secular world, unless they are in mendicant or missionary orders.. The Sangha or community of ordained Buddhist bhikkhus (Pali bhikkhu, like Sanskrit bhik\u1e63u, means 'beggar; one who lives by alms'[2]), and original bhikkhun\u012bs (nuns) were founded by Gautama Buddha during his lifetime over 2500 years ago.

The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass."

Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate."

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21]."

The Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too were absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states maintained their own armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops which, along with the Indian Army formed the land component of the Armed Forces of the Crown of India, responsible for the defence of the Indian Empire.[4][5] The Imperial Service Troops were merged into the Indian Army after independence."

As it moves, it abrades rock and debris from its substrate to create landforms such as cirques, moraines, or fjords.

He is best known for his novel Don Quixote, a work considered as the first modern novel.[6][7][8] The novel has been labelled by many well-known authors as the \"best book of all time\"[b] and the \"best and most central work in world literature\".[9][8]. Much of his life was spent in relative poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".[10].

Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967.

The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.[8]. Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).[9]. Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate."

In April 1997, when Sheridan was 17, he created a website dedicated to the Dancing Baby animation, contributing to its popularity as an early internet meme.[7][8]. Sheridan attended art school at New York's Pratt Institute for one year before being hired at age 19 by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor in 1999, on the merits of a Nine Inch Nails fansite he created during high school.[9] He was initially hired to maintain the newly launched official Nine Inch Nails website.[10] He then also took over as art director for the band, contributing photography, web design, album covers, music videos, live tour visuals, and two live concert films.[11] His tenure as art director spanned from 1999 to 2014.[12] He was also credited for assisting Trent Reznor with the mythology of the alternate reality game built around Nine Inch Nails' 2007 album Year Zero.[13] According to Nine Inch Nails lore, we\u2019re living in Year Zero, which began on February 10, 2022.

The UN Charter mandates the UN and its member states to maintain international peace and security, uphold international law, achieve \"higher standards of living\" for their citizens, address \"economic, social, health, and related problems\", and promote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\".[2] As a charter and constituent treaty, its rules and obligations are binding on all members and supersede those of other treaties.[1][3]. During the Second World War, the Allies\u2014formally known as the United Nations\u2014agreed to establish a new postwar international organization.[4] Pursuant to this goal, the UN Charter was discussed, prepared, and drafted during the San Francisco Conference that began 25 April 1945, which involved most of the world's sovereign nations.[5] Following two-thirds approval of each part, the final text was unanimously adopted by delegates and opened for signature on 26 June 1945;[6][7] it was signed in San Francisco, United States, by 50 of the 51 original member countries.[6][Note 1]. The Charter entered into force on 24 October 1945, following ratification by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council\u2014China,[Note 2] France,[Note 3] the Soviet Union,[Note 4] the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014and a majority of the other signatories; this is considered the official starting date of the United Nations, with the first session of the General Assembly, representing all 51 initial members, opening in London the following January.

He has been a senator for Florence since 2018.[1] Renzi has served as the leader of Italia Viva (IV) since 2019,[2] having been the secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) from 2013 to 2018,[3] with a brief interruption in 2017.[4]. After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014,[5] Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming prime minister the following year.[6] At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become prime minister, became the youngest person to have served as prime minister.[7] While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth,[8] a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions,[9] and the abolition of many small taxes.[10]. After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum,[11][12] Renzi formally resigned as prime minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement.[13][14] He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election.[15] In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the Italia Viva party.[16] In January 2021, Renzi revoked his party's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis.[17] In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government.[18] Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.[19][20][21]. Renzi was born on 11 January 1975 in Florence, the second of four children."

It stars Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Ewan McGregor and is a pastiche of the early-1960s American \"no-sex sex comedies\",[4] such as Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back (both starring Rock Hudson, Doris Day, and Tony Randall) and the \"myriad spawn\"[5] of derivative films that followed; Time film critic Richard Corliss wrote that Down with Love \"is so clogged with specific references to a half-dozen Rock-and-Doris-type comedies that it serves as definitive distillation of the genre.\"[4] Randall himself plays a small role in Down with Love, \"bestowing his sly, patriarchal blessing\"[6] on the film, which also stars David Hyde Pierce (in the neurotic best friend role often played by Randall or Gig Young), Sarah Paulson, Rachel Dratch, Jeri Ryan, and Jack Plotnick, who spoofs the kind of role Chet Stratton played in Lover Come Back.. Typical of the genre, the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario; the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern, post-feminist ideas and attitudes. Though the film received a mixed critical response at the time of release and underperformed at the box office, it has since undergone a critical reappraisal and grown a cult following for its subversion of rom-com conventions.[7]. In 1962, aspiring author Barbara Novak arrives in New York to submit her book, Down with Love, to Banner House publishing."

He is also the leader and a monk of the Gelug school, the newest school of Tibetan Buddhism,[3] formally headed by the Ganden Tripa. The central government of Tibet at the time of his selection, the Ganden Phodrang, invested the Dalai Lama with temporal duties until his exile in 1959.[4][5]. The 14th Dalai Lama was born to a farming family in Taktser (Hongya Village), in the traditional Tibetan region of Amdo (administratively Qinghai, Republic of China).[6][7] He was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937, and formally recognised as the 14th Dalai Lama in a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939.[8] As with the recognition process for his predecessor, a Golden Urn selection process was exempted and approved by the Central Government of the Republic of China.[9][10][11][12][13] His enthronement ceremony was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 and he eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950 (at 15 years of age), after the People's Republic of China's occupation of Tibet.[8] The Tibetan government administered the historic Tibetan regions of \u00dc-Tsang, Kham and Amdo.[14]."

            "observation": "Observation 1: No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western crime thriller film written, directed, produced and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name.[2] Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, the film is set in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas.[3] The film revisits the themes of fate, conscience, and circumstance that the Coen brothers had explored in the films Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), and Fargo (1996).[4] The film follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a Vietnam War veteran and welder who stumbles upon a large sum of money in the desert; Anton Chigurh (Bardem), a hitman who is sent to recover the money; and Ed Tom Bell (Jones), a sheriff investigating the crime. The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife, Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.[5] The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against the budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations from multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and two Golden Globes.[6] The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[7] and the National Board of Review selected it as the best of 2007.[8] It is one of only four Western films ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (the others being Cimarron in 1931, Dances with Wolves in 1990, and Unforgiven in 1992).. No Country for Old Men was considered one of the best films of 2007,[9] and many regard it as the Coen brothers' best film.[10][11][12][13] As of December\u00a02021[update], various sources had recognized it as one of the best films of the 2000s,[14][15][16] and as one of the best films of the 21st century.[17][18][19] The Guardian's John Patterson wrote: \"the Coens' technical abilities, and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah, are matched by few living directors\",[20] and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that it is \"a new career peak for the Coen brothers\" and \"as entertaining as hell\".[21] According to a study published by researchers at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, in 2014, that involved studying 400 films (1915\u20132010) and identifying 126 fictional psychopathic characters (21 female and 105 male), Anton Chigurh in \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d is the most clinically accurate portrayal of a psychopath till date.[22]."

(In the graphic, Ma means \"million years ago\".) Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula.[4][5][6] Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While the Earth was in its earliest stage (Early Earth), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia is thought to have formed the Moon."

Although only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species.

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u201379\u00a0AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u201381).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u201396).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius)..

It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles."

The event caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs. Most other tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms (55 pounds) also became extinct, with the exception of some ectothermic species such as sea turtles and crocodilians.[4] It marked the end of the Cretaceous period, and with it the Mesozoic era, while heralding the beginning of the current era, the Cenozoic. In the geologic record, the K\u2013Pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K\u2013Pg boundary or K\u2013T boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows unusually high levels of the metal iridium,[5][6][7] which is more common in asteroids than in the Earth's crust.[8]."

The film's story revolves around two sisters, one of whom marries just before a rogue planet is about to collide with Earth. Melancholia is the second film in von Trier's unofficially titled Depression Trilogy. It was preceded in 2009 by Antichrist and followed by Nymphomaniac in 2013.[5]. On 18 May 2011, Melancholia premiered at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and Dunst won the festival's Best Actress Award for her performance, which was a common area of praise among critics.[6] Many critics and film scholars have considered the film to be a masterpiece."

Interpretations of the song vary widely. Frederick Douglass wrote in his 1855 autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom that the song \"awakens sympathies for the slave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish\".[5][6] However, the song's publication by Firth & Pond as a minstrel song and its use in \"Tom shows\" (stagings of Stowe's novel of varying degrees of sincerity and faithfulness to the original text), and other settings, have clouded its reception.[2][3]. The creation of the song \"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\" established a decisive moment within Stephen Foster's career in regard to his personal beliefs on the institution of slavery, as, following publication of the song, Foster began to abandon minstrelsy and writing music with African-American vernacular.[7] It also is an example of the common theme of the loss of home, which is prevalent throughout Foster's work."

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21]."

His 1976 book The Selfish Gene popularised the gene-centred view of evolution, as well as coining the term meme. Dawkins has won several academic and writing awards.[5]. Dawkins is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design as well as for being a vocal atheist.[6] Dawkins wrote The Blind Watchmaker in 1986, arguing against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker, in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any sentient designer."

Having formed Island Records in Jamaica on 22 May 1959 when he was nearly 22, Blackwell was among the first to record the Jamaican popular music that eventually became known as ska.[2] Returning to Britain in 1962, he sold records from the back of his car to the Jamaican community.[3] His label became \"a byword for uncompromised artistry and era-shaping acts.\"[7]. Backed by Stanley Borden from RKO, Blackwell's business and reach grew substantially, and he went on to forge the careers of Bob Marley, Grace Jones and U2 among many other diverse high-profile acts.[2] He has produced many seminal albums, including Marley's Catch A Fire and Uprising,[8] Free's Free and The B-52's' self-titled debut album in 1979.. Having sold Island in 1989, Blackwell embarked on ventures in \"hotels, real estate, resorts, another record company, rum, and his Island Films released Kiss of the Spider Woman and Stop Making Sense, among others.\"[5]. In 2022, he published a memoir, The Islander: My Life in Music and Beyond.[9][10]."
